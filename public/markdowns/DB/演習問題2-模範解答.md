# DB_演習問題2_模範解答

---

## 基本

```sql
/* ① AND条件、並べ替え */
SELECT * FROM student WHERE grade = 1 AND hometown = '東京' ORDER BY student_id;

/* ② OR条件、LIKE指定、並べ替え */
SELECT * FROM student WHERE grade = 1 OR student_name LIKE '%本' ORDER BY student_id DESC;

/* ③ GROUP BY、MAX */
SELECT major_id, MAX(grade) FROM student GROUP BY major_id ORDER BY major_id;

/* ④ GROUP BY、COUNT、HAVING */
SELECT hometown, COUNT(*) FROM student GROUP BY hometown HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2 ORDER BY hometown;

/* ⑤ JOIN、並べ替え */
SELECT student_name, major_name FROM student s JOIN major m ON s.major_id = m.major_id ORDER BY major_name, student_name;

/* ⑥ JOIN、条件指定、並べ替え */
SELECT student_id, student_name, hometown, major_name FROM student s JOIN major m ON s.major_id = m.major_id WHERE hometown <> '東京' ORDER BY major_name, student_id;

/* ⑦ サブクエリ - その1 */
SELECT student_id, student_name, grade FROM student WHERE major_id = (
  SELECT major_id FROM major WHERE major_name = '英文学'
) ORDER BY student_id;

/* ⑧ サブクエリ - その2 */
SELECT student_id, student_name, major_id FROM student WHERE major_id IN (
  SELECT major_id FROM student GROUP BY major_id HAVING COUNT(*) >=  3
) ORDER BY major_id, student_id;
```

## 発展

```sql
/* ① CERATE */
CREATE TABLE sales_old (
  sales_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  order_date DATE,
  customer_id INT NOT NULL REFERENCES customer(customer_id),
  amount DECIMAL
);

/* ② INSERT */
INSERT INTO sales_old VALUES
  (6, '2018/09/02', 2, 20000),
  (7, '2018/09/02', 1, 5000),
  (8, '2018/09/02', 3, 6000),
  (9, '2018/09/05', 1, 3000);

/* ③ INSERT、SELECT */
INSERT INTO sales
SELECT * FROM sales_old;

/* ④ DROP */
DROP TABLE sales_old;

/* ⑤ CASE WHEN */
SELECT sales_id, order_date, (CASE WHEN order_date < '2018/10/01' THEN '〇' ELSE '' END) AS is_old
FROM sales
ORDER BY order_date;

/* ⑥ 文字列結合 */
SELECT customer_id || ':' || customer_name AS customer_id_name
FROM customer
ORDER BY customer_id;

/* ⑦ LIMIT */
SELECT * FROM sales WHERE customer_id = 1
ORDER BY order_date DESC LIMIT 2;

/* ⑧ GROUP BY、MIN、SUM、サブクエリ */
SELECT order_date, SUM(amount) AS sum_amount
FROM sales WHERE order_date = (SELECT MIN(order_date) FROM sales)
GROUP BY order_date;

/* ⑨ GROUP BY、AVG、JOIN、TRUNC */
SELECT s.customer_id, customer_name, TRUNC(AVG(amount)) AS avg_amount
FROM sales AS s JOIN customer AS c ON s.customer_id = c.customer_id
GROUP BY s.customer_id, customer_name
ORDER BY s.customer_id;

/* ⑩ BETWEEN、LIMIT、サブクエリ */
SELECT * FROM sales WHERE sales_id = (
  SELECT sales_id FROM sales WHERE order_date BETWEEN '2018/09/01' AND '2018/09/30'
  ORDER BY amount DESC LIMIT 1
);
